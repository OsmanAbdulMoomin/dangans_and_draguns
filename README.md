# DANGANS AND DRAGUNS - A SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME IN REACTJS + NODE + EXPRESS

## RULES 

1. Players start off in a communal lobby, and are assigned a faction : student or traitor

2. Once factions are assigned, each player is given a unique role which affords them a certain power they can use during the game i.e a bonus to stats or an ability to switch rooms during the interaction phase (explained below)

3. The game consists 3 phases, Community Room Phase, Interaction Phase and Night Phase

3a. Community Room Phase : Players can select a room to go to during interaction phase, you can tell others players where you want to go, but can lie by selecting a different room with the buttons; only 3 players may enter a room, if a 4th player attempts to enter a room, they will be eliminated immediately

3b. Interaction Phase: Players interact in the rooms they choose. You can find hints and tools to help (or hinder) the players escape. Players may attack each other in these rooms, but if a non-traitor player is defeated by another player, they will be penalised for the rest of the game.

3c. Night Phase : During the night phase players go to sleep. Traitors can break locks and sneak into players' rooms but breaking a lock takes  a day to do and players will be notified that their doorlock is broken.

4. Combat is conducted through dice rolls, like dungeons and dragons, and takes into account bonuses from weapons or traits afforded by player roles.
